# 🎓 VR Classroom Multiplayer – AI-Powered Virtual Meeting Space

🚀 Built during the **Imagine Cup Ideathon**, this project reimagines traditional online meetings and virtual classrooms.  
We created a **3D AI-powered, multiplayer virtual environment** that enhances engagement, interactivity, and learning — all with **no extra hardware** required.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Traditional online meetings and virtual classrooms lack the natural interaction and engagement found in physical settings. Participants often feel disconnected, and tools for collaboration are limited and static.

Our goal was to build an **immersive, interactive, and intelligent** environment that simulates real-world interactions in a digital classroom — scalable for schools, universities, and enterprises.

## ✅ Solution

We developed a **3D multiplayer virtual classroom** using Unity that includes:

- Real-time animated avatars
- AI-powered tutor chatbot
- Interactive whiteboard
- Seamless multiplayer experience via Photon
- Scalable backend via Azure PlayFab
